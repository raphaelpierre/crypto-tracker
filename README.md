## 🤖 What's This Cyberpunk Madness?

Welcome to CryptoPunk Tracker, where we turn boring cryptocurrency data into a neon-soaked, cyberpunk fever dream! Because who said financial data can't look like it's straight out of Blade Runner?

## ✨ Features That'll Make Your GPU Sweat

- 🌈 Retina-burning neon colors (sunglasses not included)
- 📊 Real-time crypto prices (faster than you can say "HODL")
- 💎 Market cap calculations (basically rocket science)
- 🔍 Search function (in case you forgot what BTC stands for)
- 🎮 Cyberpunk UI (we raided CD Projekt Red's recycling bin)

## 🚀 Quick Start (No Red Pills Required)

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/raphaelpierre/crypto-tracker.git

# Enter the matrix
cd crypto-tracker

# Install dependencies (like upgrading your cybernetic implants)
npm install

# Fire up the engines
npm start
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Open your browser (preferably something from this century)
2. Navigate to the app
3. Watch numbers go up and down
4. Resist the urge to mortgage your house to buy more crypto
5. Repeat

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Is this financial advice?**
A: If you're taking financial advice from a README, we need to have a serious talk.

**Q: Why is everything glowing?**
A: Because in cyberpunk, everything glows. It's the law.

**Q: Can I trade crypto here?**
A: Nope, this is just a tracker. Like a Fitbit for your crypto addiction.
